            <p>
              Cake-G was created in 2019  to cater to the needs of Nepalese based overseas who
              wish to send gifts to family and friends in their home country. It was amongst the
              first Nepal centric e-commerce companies providing a leading platform for delivery
              of high quality merchandise and services to the Non-resident Nepali community (NRN).
              Creation of this service enabled the company to put in place a large logistics system,
              relationships with high recognition brands in the Nepali market and a robust distribution
              process.
